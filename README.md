# java-crud-app

The app was develop using codefirst approach meaning schema will be created based on what I've placed on the Model
once the app starts running the data will automatically be created assuming postgres credentials has been updated based on 
your config

### Structure

Each logic that endpoint uses for the CRUD operations are to be found on the service layer. I've consolidated those logic for ease of checking and 
to ensure each class does one responsibility
